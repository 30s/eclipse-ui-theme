### Notes:

Tested on the following Eclipse release:

* Juno (4.2)

Works best with a dark system theme since currently the look of some GUI widgets cannot be overriden directly in Eclipse (eg. button, scrollbar, dialog window, etc.) and a dark color scheme for the Eclipse code editor (you can create your own or download one from http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/).
