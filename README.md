Requirements
------------

* Eclipse 4.2+

Installation
------------

Download the JAR package and put it into your Eclipse ```dropins``` folder:

[com.github.eclipsecolortheme.themes_0.6.2.jar](https://github.com/guari/eclipse-ui-theme/blob/master/com.github.eclipseuitheme.themes/bin/com.github.eclipsecolortheme.themes_0.6.2.jar?raw=true)

Restart Eclipse and go to *Preferences > General > Appearance* and choose *MoonRise*

### Notes:

Tested on the following Eclipse release:

* Juno (4.2)

Works best with a dark system theme since currently the look of some GUI widgets cannot be overriden directly in Eclipse (eg. button, scrollbar, dialog window, etc.) and a dark color scheme for the Eclipse code editor (you can create your own or download one from http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/).
